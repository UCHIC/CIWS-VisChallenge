# CIWS Project Summary

# Purpose
Continuous data is provided by our current research into Cyber-Infrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply(CIWS). This challenge allows participants to visualize water use data in potentially novel and innovative ways to provide feedback to water users for various purposes.

# Need for Detailed Data
Most water use data is collected at monthly to quarterly time scales. While useful and adequate for billing purposes, these data do not provide information about timing of water use or other behavioral characteristics, nor do they provide information about structural or demographic characteristics that might help predict future demand. 

Our current research has led to the development of high resolution water meters. These meters can provide time series of data with resolutions up to one recording per second. This high resolution can reveal information about timing of water use, such as what hours of the day peak water use occurs. Additionally, end uses (e.g., toilets, showers, sinks) can be identified by tracing the signal of water use, effectively providing information about the kinds of end uses used. While this may be difficult without a proper training dataset, end use disaggregation is a highly valuable use of this high resolution data. 

# Novelty of Data

Some companies develop water-use data collection infrastructure that collects and analyzes water use data at high frequencies, but these toolsâ€™ codes are not open-source. As a result, the means in which the data is visualized and provided to the user cannot be altered. Our data and visualization methods will be publicly accessible. Additionally, computation and disaggregation of water use can be performed at the collection site to make the data stored and transmitted more efficient. This ease of access and ability to shrink the large volume of data should provide more detailed data to households and their respective water users.
