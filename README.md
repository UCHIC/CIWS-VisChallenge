# Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply (CIWS) Data Visualization Challenge

As part of a research project funded by the United States National Science Foundation, the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University sponsors a data visualization challenge. This repository provides details about the challenge, links to the datasets available for the challenge, submissions from past challenges, and instructions for submitting entries.

**NOTE: The 2018-2019 challenge is complete. You can find results of the challenge, including the winning entries [here](https://github.com/UCHIC/CIWS-VisChallenge/tree/master/2018-2019_Challenge). Information about upcoming challenges will be posted to this repostory, so make sure you check back or contact our research team.**

## The Challenge

Our research group is developing cyberinfrastructure to better support the collection, management, and use of smart water metering data. This Challenge provides students at Utah State University with an opportunity to develop visualizations of high resolution water use data that are potentially novel and innovative. We aim to develop new approaches for providing visual feedback to both water providers (e.g., your municipality that provides your drinking water) and you as a water consumer. 

Visualizations devloped for this challenge should be focused on creating visual information that would be useful for either water users (to inform them about thier water consumption) or water providers (e.g., the municipality delivering the water). Given this, the objective is to create visualizations that are easily understandable and may provide actionable information (e.g., the homeowner can see thier water use visually and may change thier behavoir based on the information you provide).

## Who Can Participate?

We are encourage submissions from students in both Computer Science and Engineering departments at USU, but we are happy to receive submissions from any students at USU. For the 2018-2019 challenge we limited submissions to students at Utah State University; however, in future versions of the challenge we may open it up to students or others outside of USU. Participants may be at the undergraduate or graduate level.

## Getting Started and How to Submit an Entry

Details of how to make a submission will be posted with upcoming challenges.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Our project is focused on open source code development. A condition of receiving prizes for winning entries as part of this challenge will be that you must allow us to upload your source code and/or submission files to this GitHub repository. 

## Visit the Documentation Pages

We have developed a set of documentation pages that provide background about our research project along with links to supporting literature. You may find ideas for developing innovative and effective visualizations of the datasets at the link below.
