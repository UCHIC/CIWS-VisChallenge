# Visualization Challenge Datasets

The following are the datasets for the 2020 visualization challenge. Visualization challenge entries may use either or both of these datasets.

## Single-Household Residential Raw Water Use Data
This dataset consists of raw water use data collected on the residential water meter of a single-family residence. Data were collected using a custom datalogger that senses the number of "pulses" generated by the water meter and records the count of pulses approximately every 4 seconds. Each individual "pulse" corresponds to a volume of 0.033 gallons that have passed through the meter. Data for the entire time period were compiled into a single comma-separated values file that is available at the following link:

## Single-Household Residential Water Use Event Data
This dataset consists of water use event data for the same single-family residence. These events were extracted from the raw data file posted above.
