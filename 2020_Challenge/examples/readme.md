# 2020 Visualization Challenge Examples

This folder contains the examples that were presented by Camilo and Nour at the Information Meeting that was held on October 21, 2020. Their examples are in the folders with their name.

Nour's example has been uploaded as a Python Script and a Python Jupyter notebook so that it can be executed in pretty much any Python environment. Nour's examples assume that the data files are in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook or Python script. You will need the following Python libraries to execute Nour's code:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* datetime
* seaborn

Camilo wrote his examples in R and demonstrated his visualizations in the R-Studio software. You don't need to R-Studio to run Camilo's code, but you would need to install R. Camilo's code assumes that the input data files are in the same folder as the R script. Camilo used the following R packages in his example that you will have to install into your R environment if you want to run his code:
* lubridate
* tidyverse
